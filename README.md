Here you will find just a few simple FLTK programs intended to get the
FLTK beginner off the ground with the first couple of programs. The
hardest part about FLTK is getting the first program to build! The
library itself is one of the simplest toolkits available today -- a
working GUI in just a few lines of code. FLTK has a very nice GLUT
layer to give GLUT programmers a bit more functionality than they have
with GLUT and base OpenGL.

You can read a bit more about these examples on my [home page](https://www.mitchr.me/SS/exampleCode/fltk.html).

Have fun!
